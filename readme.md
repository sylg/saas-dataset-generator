# SaaS Fake Dataset Generator

Currently spit out 2 CSV files in `/output`, `events.csv` & `users.csv`. 

`user_generator.rb` take only one argument, the number of user you want to generate. ex `ruby user_generator.rb 200`



## TODO 

- [ ] convert to CLI
- [ ] Option to push data to a DB and not only CSV
- [ ] Add Payment data to generate revenue metrics (currently broken)
- [ ] Add more event type and sample name & data
- [ ] Add concept of Organizations
